# nickName123 chrome_ext
Project for CSE 331 Introduction to Computer Security

A chrome extension, made to parse information from the user, taking usernames/passwords/browser history/execute malicious attacks on infected client.

Purely academic, as the extension was not published to chrome store.

As it parses information from the user, it sends information to Herokue server with the user is unique ID, stored on the chrome cache.
